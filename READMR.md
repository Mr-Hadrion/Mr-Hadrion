- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mr-Hadrion
- 👀 I’m interested in meeting new coders, codist, and codifiers while working toward my passion of becoming financially independent.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use debian as a backdrop to learning python in my CIDM course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on system architecture development.
- 📫 How to reach me on github?
- 😄 Pronouns: This architype has grown legacy devisive and addent tendencies. Mister (Mr.) Hadrion is perfectly civil.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I use to love to program until I started getting paid to do it. Now, I hate the work and would rather guide the programmer's lead while using my business knowledge to manage the books.
- 😎 I forgot what I was going to add.
